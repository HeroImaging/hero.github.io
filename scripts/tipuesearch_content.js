{"title": "Home", "text": "Welcome to Hero! Hero is a user-friendly graphical programming interface that provides advanced tools for complex image processing and analysis. It simplifies the work process and saves time by generating results suited to the user's particular needs, be it further analysis or formal presentation of research. Hero is designed for professionals in various medical areas such as radiotherapy, radiology, and pathology. It aims to make advanced and complex image processing and analysis available to all professionals. Downloading The latest stable release of Hero is version 2023.1.1. You can download it from the link below: Download Stable v2023.1.1 Installing Install the software by running the downloaded .exe file. The installation requires approximately 3 GB of free space. License To run the software, you'll need a license. If you don't have one, you can register for a trial license HERE. If you need access to all features, you'll need a premium license. You can order one HERE. When you run the software, the license will be verified against a license server. An internet connection is required to validate the license, so make sure that your institution's firewall does not block this connection. Virtual Machines If you need to use Hero on a virtual machine, please contact us. Hardware Requirements OS Hero can be installed and run on Windows 10 or Windows 11. CPU Hero uses multiple threads for most of the processing, fast multi core CPU is preferred. Memory Image analysis is memory intensive! We recommend at least 8GB of RAM for most applications. Graphics Hero uses VTK to visualize images.Please read the following statement taken from the VTK/FAQ before deciding on a graphics card: Modern graphics cards that supports OpenGL 2.1 or better typically provide all the functionality that VTK needs. However, there is good deal of variability in results across OS platform and vendor's OpenGL implementation. NVidia cards and drivers work the best. Intel HD integrated graphics and ATI Radeon HD devices and drivers are known to have a few issues. Mesa3D OpenGL although claiming support for a wide range of devices is highly unstable and the overall buggy-ness of their implementation changes daily and by renderer. Mesa's llvmpipe drivers are expected to generally work well. Our experience tells us that NVidia cards are the most compatible. Disk Space The installation requires approximately 2 GB of free space.

Consider an exampel of an image. The \(\beta\) value can be thought of the offset on the pixel value that you are trying to isolate. E.g., if the object you are trying to isolate is at a pixel intensity above 150, you would choose a \(\beta\) value that is around that value. The \(\alpha\) value can be thought of as the scaling or variance of the sigmoid. Lower \(\alpha\) values will make the pixel range of your intensity sharper. Your \(\alpha\) value would decide how much of the noise you would want to include in your transformation. Smaller \(\alpha\) values (0.25, 0.5) would zero out most of the noise, but it might make your actual signal thicker and not specific enough.

This method is particularly useful for images that have bimodal histograms, where the background and foreground pixels have distinct intensity levels. The threshold value is calculated by maximizing the inter-class variance. Otsu's thresholding is a simple and efficient method for image segmentation, and is widely used in image processing and computer vision applications. Inputs Input Input image(s). Type: Image, List, Required, Single Outputs Output Output mask(s). Type: Mask, List Threshold The threshold value found using Otsu's method.

{"title": "Export as DICOM (.dcm)", "text": "Export DICOM Convert and save connected images to DICOM files on disk. DICOM is a standardized image format for storing and sending medical images from many different modalities. With each image comes extensive metadata information regaring e.g. imaging modality, imaging settings, scan time and date, patient information etc. Many metadata tags are specific to one modality, which makes a function that fully adheres to the DICOM standard difficult to implement. This is important if images are imported in other software such as dose planning programs or sent to a DICOM node or PACS for storage. For this reason, Hero currently supports three DICOM image export modalities; CT, MRI, and RTDOSE. Quantization errors in DICOM DICOM can only save pixel data in integer values between 0 and 65,535. To represent decimal values, a linear transformation is applied to the pixel data. The slope and intercept of this transformation is calculated so that the range of integer values in the dicom image covers the dynamic range of the values being stored. For large pixel ranges this method will lead to quantization error. To minimize the ammount of quantization, make sure you limit the range of values in the images. Voxels with extreme values outside the window of interest will lead to a large quantization error. This is illustrated in the figure below. The figure shows two image histograms after a linear transformation. The images are identical, except for a few outlier voxel values of 100 in the right image. In this toy example, there are 50 gray levels available. If the span of intensities is [0 - 15], the quantization error is quite small. However, if the span is [0 - 100], the quantization error is much larger. Inputs Image Input Image. Type: Image, Required, Single Settings Modality Selection Modality selection. Values: CT, MR, RTDOSE Force Integer Values Boolean If enabled, the node will attempt to store voxel values as integers. Note that this setting will be ignored if the modality is set to RTDOSE. The slope will always be 1, and the intercept will be adjusted accordingly. The voxel values will be rounded to the nearest integer. If the range of values in the image exceeds 65535, values outside of this range will be clipped to 65535. Please use caution when enabling this feature as it can greatly alter your data. It is only recommended to do so if you have a full understanding of its effects. Out Path Path Path to the folder where the exported images should be saved.

{"title": "To Mask", "text": "Contour To Mask Renders countours to binary mask (or a fuzzy mask) on a reference image. Inputs Contour The contours to render. Type: Contour, List, Required, Single Reference The reference image(s) or mask(s) which provides the matrix (i.e. image position, voxel size etc) on which to render the contours. Type: Mask, Image, List, Required, Single Outputs Mask The rendered contours as Mask(s). Type: Mask, List Fuzzy Mask The rendered contours as Image(s), or fuzzy mask(s). A fuzzy mask is a type of binary mask that assigns a degree of membership to each pixel in an image, rather than a simple 0 or 1 value. The degree of membership ranges between 0 and 1, where a value of 1 indicates that the pixel is fully a member of the set and a value of 0 indicates that the pixel is not a member of the set. Fuzzy masks are commonly used in image processing for tasks such as image segmentation, edge detection, and pattern recognition, as they allow for more nuanced and flexible representation of image features compared to binary masks. This is especially impotant for small structures which have a relativly large fraction of edge pixels. Type: Image, List Statistics Statistics regarding the mask and fuzzy mask, such as volumes and volume error. Volume error is the relative difference between the volume calculated directly from the polygon structure compared to the rendered binary and smooth mask. Type: Table Settings Contour Selection Contour Name(s) Text Name of the contours to render, if you define several structures as a comma separated list it will render the first structure that matches. To select a contour that has a name that contains comma, use the escape character '\,'. Condition Selection Condition to use when matching strings to find the structure. Values: Contains, Equals, Does Not Contain, Not Equal, Regex Case Sensitive Boolean When enabled a case sensitive string match will be used. Configure Supersampling Method Selection Supersampling increases the accuracy of the rendered volume by creating a fuzzy mask. A fuzzy mask is a Hero specific concept which allows polygonal structures to be rendered on an image, allowing fractional values between 0 and 1. If the polygon cuts a voxel precisely diagonally, the voxel value of the fuzzy mask at that voxel will be 0.5. When producing different statistics based on regions of interest, these can be weighted by the intensity of the fuzzy mask, greatly improving the accuracy especially for structures with small volumes. Note that the fuzzy mask is an ordinary Image and not a specific datatype, so the user must ensure that the input really is a fuzzy mask to avoid nonsense statistics. None of course means that no supersampling takes place. Two-Step implies that the supersampling is done in two steps, where the Initial step supersamples the whole image, and the Refined step supersamples the voxels with values between 0 and 1. Dynamic is an iterative process where the supersampling tries to achieve a certain volume rendering accuracy (comparing the volume of the actual polygons to the volume in the rendered fuzzy mask). Values: None, Two-Step, Dynamic Mask Threshold [%] SettingsFloat Sets how much of a single voxel that needs to be inside the structure for the voxel to be set to TRUE in the mask. Mask Threshold Type Selection The type of criteria used to set the resulting mask voxel to TRUE. Values: Equal, Greater Than, Greater or Equal, Less Than, Less or Equal, Not Equal End Cap Thickness [mm] SettingsFloat Sets the end cap thickness of the structure. Two-Step Supersampling Initial Method Selection Set the initial supersampling method. Regular Grid divides the image grid (or matrix) into subvoxels, defined by the &ldquo;Initial Subvoxel Ratio&rdquo;. Monte Carlo randomly samples positions in voxels the number of times specified in the Initial Num. Points per Voxel. Values: Regular Grid, Monte Carlo Initial Subvoxel Ratio Integers Set how two divide a voxel to produce subvoxels, defined as [i, j, k]. If you specify, e.g. [2, 2, 4], each voxel will be divid into 2 in the i direction, 2 in the j direction and 4 in the k direction. Initial Points per Voxel Integer Set the number of points to sample per voxel with the Monte Carlo method. Refined Method Selection Set the method for the refined supersampling. See the section under Initial Method for additional information. Values: None, Regular Grid, Monte Carlo Refined Subvoxel Ratio Integers Set how two divide a voxel to produce subvoxels, defined as [i, j, k]. If you specify, e.g. [2, 2, 4], each voxel will be divid into 2 in the i direction, 2 in the j direction and 4 in the k direction. Refined Points per Voxel Integer Set the number of points to sample per voxel with the Monte Carlo method. Dynamic Supersampling Maximum Volume Error [%] SettingsFloat The maximum volume error in %, i.e. \(\left| \dfrac{V_{polygons}}{V_{rendered}} - 1\right|*100\) that the filter tries to achieve by iterating with increasingly finer supersampling. Maximum Iterations Integer The maximum number of iterations for trying to achieve an error lower than the specified Maximum Volume Error [%]. Use Error Stopping Criterion Boolean Use Error Stopping Criterion will stop the calculations if the volume error has not improved by a certain amount, specified in the Error Stopping Criterion [%], compared to the last iteration. This will stop the algorithm from running all iterations set in the Maximum Iterations settings when the target error probably won't be reached.

Consider an exampel of an image. The \(\beta\) value can be thought of the offset on the pixel value that you are trying to isolate. E.g., if the object you are trying to isolate is at a pixel intensity above 150, you would choose a \(\beta\) value that is around that value. The \(\alpha\) value can be thought of as the scaling or variance of the sigmoid. Lower \(\alpha\) values will make the pixel range of your intensity sharper. Your \(\alpha\) value would decide how much of the noise you would want to include in your transformation. Smaller \(\alpha\) values (0.25, 0.5) would zero out most of the noise, but it might make your actual signal thicker and not specific enough.

Consider an exampel of an image. The \(\beta\) value can be thought of the offset on the pixel value that you are trying to isolate. E.g., if the object you are trying to isolate is at a pixel intensity above 150, you would choose a \(\beta\) value that is around that value. The \(\alpha\) value can be thought of as the scaling or variance of the sigmoid. Lower \(\alpha\) values will make the pixel range of your intensity sharper. Your \(\alpha\) value would decide how much of the noise you would want to include in your transformation. Smaller \(\alpha\) values (0.25, 0.5) would zero out most of the noise, but it might make your actual signal thicker and not specific enough.

{"title": "Gamma Index", "text": "Gamma Index Calculates the gamma index, first introduced by Low et al, between a reference and an evaluation dose distribution in 3D with sub-voxel accuracy according to the algorithm described by Wendling et al. It will only calculate the gamma index for reference voxels &gt;0. Definition of the gamma index The gamma index combines the dose difference and the distance difference into a dimensionless metric. In principle, this metric should be calculated for each reference point against all points in the evaluated dose distribution. The gamma statistic is calculated as \[ \begin{equation} \Gamma(\textbf{r}_R,\textbf{r}_E) = \sqrt{\frac{\Delta r^2(\textbf{r}_R,\textbf{r}_E)}{\delta r^2} + \frac{\Delta D^2(\textbf{r}_R,\textbf{r}_E)}{\delta D^2}} \label{eq:sample} \end{equation} \] where \(\delta r\) is the distance criterion (distance to agreement or DTA) and \(\delta D\) is the dose difference criterion. The \(\gamma\) is then taken as the minimum \(\Gamma\) value over all evaluated points. If \(\gamma &lt; 1\), that point will pass. Standard values for \(\delta r\) is 3 mm and \(\delta D\) is 3%, and a standard value for accepting agreement between two distributions is usually that 97% of all evaluated points should pass. Inputs Reference Dose An Image containing the dose matrix to be used as reference. This image is normally produced by importing a DICOM RT DOSE, or RD file. Type: Image, List, Required, Single Evaluated Dose An Image containing the dose matrix to be evaluated. This image is normally produced by importing a DICOM RT DOSE, or RD file. It must have the same matrix size as the reference dose. Type: Image, List, Required, Single Mask A Mask which specifies in which area the gamma index should be evaluated. It only applies to points in the evaluated dose. It must have the same matrix size as the reference dose.

Type: Table, List Settings Dose Criteria [%] SettingsFloat Set the dose criterion. Distance Criteria [mm] SettingsFloat Set the distance criterion. Search Radius [mm] SettingsFloat Set the radius of the sphere around each evaluated voxel to evaluate the gamma index for. If the user desires a pass/fail gamma evaluation, the Search Radius can be set equal to Distance Criteria. If a more thorough evaluation is desired, set the Search Radius to at least 3 times the Distance Criteria. Increasing the search radius increases the computation time. Step Size [mm] SettingsFloat Determines the resolution of the evaluation, i.e. the accuracy of the interpolation. Recommended step size is at most 1 / 3 of the distance to agreement(DTA) and a fraction of the resolution of the voxel size. As an example, for a 1 mm DTA and voxel size of 2 mm, a step size of 0.25 mm would be suitable. Increasing resolution increases computation time. <!--- :::box #### Select Dose Reference Selection Select the reference dose level for the evaluation. If comparing the gamma distribution on a local level, i.e. not normalized to the prescribed dose, select **Neighborhood Dose**. This will check the dose difference at each individual sample point and normalize it to the dose level in the current reference voxel. The gamma distribution is usually calculated with **Prescribed Dose** as reference.---> <!--- :::tiny Values: **Prescribed Dose, Neighborhood Dose** ::: ::: ---> Prescribed Dose [Gy] SettingsFloat The dose to which the dose criteria is related to.

{"title": "Equivalent Uniform Dose", "text": "Equivalent Uniform Dose Calculates the equivalent uniform dose (EUD), tumor control probability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) to volumes, which can be used for quantitatively comparing and reporting inhomogeneous dose distributions based on radiobiological effect. The EUD parameter summarizes the 3D dose distribution in a volume to a dose &ldquo;which, when distributed uniformely across the target volume, cases the survival of the same number of clonogens&rdquo;, as described by Niemierko. EUD is calculated as follows: \[ \begin{equation} EUD = \left(\sum_i{v_i D_i^a}\right)^{1/a} \label{eq:1} \end{equation} \] where \(v_i\) is the fractional organ volume recieving a dose \(D_i\) and \(a\) is a tissue specific parameter that describes the volume effect. TCP is calculated as \[ \begin{equation} TCP = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{TCD_{50}}{EUD}\right)^{4\gamma50}} \label{eq:2} \end{equation} \] where \(\gamma_{50}\) describes the slope of the dose-response curve. \(TCD_{50}\) is the dose to control 50% of the tumors.

Dose-Reponse Slope (γ50) [1] SettingsFloat Slope of the dose-response curve. The dose-response slope measures the relationship between radiation dose and the level of cell killing in a tumor. A steeper slope means the tumor is more sensitive to radiation and less radiation is needed for the same level of cell killing, while a flatter slope means the opposite.

{"title": "ADC", "text": "ADC To calculate an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map based on diffusion weighted images, at least two volumes with different b-values are required. An optional mask can also be provided to limit the calculations to a region of interest. Two methods can be used for the calculation of the ADC map: a linear (fast) method and a nonlinear (slower) method. Both methods typically produce good results, but the linear method involves taking the logarithm of a signal before fitting parameters and may not treat noise optimally. Therefore, for lower signal-to-noise ratio data, the nonlinear method is preferred. The estimation is based on a signal equation \[ S_i = S_0 \exp(-b_i \cdot ADC), i=0,1,2,\ldots. n \] where \(i\) is an index over \(n\) images acquired with different b-values. The unit of the ADC map in determined by the unit of the b-values. A common b-value unit used in most MRI scanners and in DICOM tags are \(\textrm{s}/\textrm{mm}^2\), and common b-values are in the range [0, 2000]. This gives the unit of the ADC map in \(\textrm{mm}^2/\textrm{s}\). This is usually multiplied by a factor of 1e6 to give ADC values in approximate range [0, 3500]. Another common unit for b-values is \(\textrm{ms}/\mu\textrm{m}^2\), and common b-values are in the range [0, 2]. This gives the unit of the ADC map in \(\mu\textrm{m}^2/\textrm{ms}\), and ADC values are in the approximate range [0, 3.5]. One benefit of these values are that they don't require scaling to be easily readable without scientific notification. Inputs Dataset Input diffusion weighted dataset.

{"title": "2023.1.1", "text": "2023.1.1 What's Changed New Features: Added snapping for wires, and vertical and horizontal alignment. Align input and outputs buttons now cycle through every connection. Now it's really easy to keep the workflows clean and tidy! Column index now displayed in table viewer New Node: Label Map to Mask New Node: Create Numeric Meshgrid New Node: Export Nrrd. Updates Morphology nodes now handle both images and masks Removed limit of 6 layers in Visualize node Support for import json metadata when importing Nifti Changed default name of output histogram table Added support for drag-and-drop ice.gz, .hdata.gz and hxdata.gz to workflow Allow negative indices in Split Numeric Array. Like in e.g. numpy, -1 represents the last element, and -2 the second to last etc. Exported nifti compressed by default Elastix output image is now optional. Disable the output if you only want the transform, and want to save memory by not returning the image to the workflow. Force transform to run exclusively. This will prevent crashes caused by non-thread safe functions in the ITK library. All object attributes in the python library are now identical to the corresponding properties in Hero. For example, the &ldquo;Position&rdquo; property of an image in Hero had the corresponding attribute &ldquo;position&rdquo; in the python library, to conform to the naming conventions of PEP 8. Now the properties and attributes are identical. Bug fixes Several small fixes in the plugin editor Wrong output type in Apply Transform Fixed bug in settings in Geometric Shape node Fixed bug when applying deformation field &ldquo;Name&rdquo; field exposed for wrong input types in save to database node Export nodes now obey the compression setting Visualization &ldquo;sag&rdquo; orientation spelling has been corrected. Fixed scrolling issue in visualizer. N4 Bias field correction now handles list inputs correctly RTSTRUCT export of oblique frames of references are now supported. Files without file extension are now visible in the Open File dialogue window Struct name from plugin output is now correct Empty fields in Create Structure node now prevent the node from executing DVH calculates Mean correctly Gamma index now handles lists correctly ", "tags": "", "url": "release_notes.2023.1.1.html"},
